# Lox Interpreter in Java

An implementation of the Lox programming language interpreter in Java, developed for study purposes.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Lox Interpreter project! This repository contains a Java-based interpreter for the Lox programming language, built as a learning exercise to understand how interpreters and programming languages are designed and implemented.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into several key components:

1. **Scanner (Lexer)**: Converts source code into a series of tokens.
2. **Parser**: Analyzes tokens according to grammar rules to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
3. **Interpreter**: Traverses the AST to execute the program.
4. **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful syntax and runtime error messages.
5. **Extensions**: Additional features and optimizations to enhance the language.
